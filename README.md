# Shape Area Calculator (TASK 1)


This Python program calculates the area of various shapes such as rectangles, circles, and triangles based on user input. It provides a simple command-line interface for users to specify the shape and its dimensions.

## Getting Started

To run the program, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where the code is located.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:


## Usage

The program will prompt you to enter the number of arguments (1, 2, or 3) based on the shape you want to calculate the area for.

### Circle

If you choose 1 argument, you can calculate the area of a circle. Enter the radius when prompted.

### Rectangle

If you choose 2 arguments, you can calculate the area of a rectangle. Enter the length and width when prompted.

### Triangle

If you choose 3 arguments, you can calculate the area of a triangle. Enter the base, height, and specify the shape type as "triangle" when prompted.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program to calculate the area of a rectangle:

1. Enter the number of arguments: 2
2. Enter the length: 5
3. Enter the width: 3

The program will display:


## Error Handling

The program provides error handling for various scenarios:

- If you enter an invalid number of arguments, it will display an error message.
- If you enter non-numeric values when prompted for dimensions, it will display an error message.
- If you enter an invalid shape type for a triangle, it will display an error message.
